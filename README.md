## Political Science Admission Results.

In this pet project I built an R Shiny dashboard to explore when I should expect to hear back from my Political Science PhD applications. If you are unfamiliar with the process, PhD applications come with a lot of anxiety, in particular once, after you have submitted your apps early to mid-December, you have to wait 2-3 months to hear about schools' decisions.

A lot of information about previous years is available on the popular forum [Grad Cafe](https://www.thegradcafe.com/survey/index.php?q=Political+Science). But it wasn't easy to visualize the data in order to get an easy glimpse at expected admission dates.

So I scraped the data and made it a dashboard. All the code should be in this repo. The finalized app is available on [my blog](https://martindevaux.com/2020/11/political-science-phd-admission-decisions/).
